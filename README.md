# Vessel-Management-App
My previous app but now with less Army....

Previously, I made Personnel Log book to log thier hours at sea, vessels served on, career courses and any other career data.

From that I built an equipment management section of the app which logged inspection and servicing dates and vessel details. My previous unit had a wide variety of vessels and equipment so this ended up being the main chunk of the App.

I also added a currency and competancy chart to ensure people who hadn't served on a particular vessel/piece of equipment had instructions for trading by a competant person

Finally there was an Engineering/Mariner Officer sign off section, so an individuals records could be accounted and signed for by said officers for accountability.

Previously I used Excel spreadsheets converted to PowerApps, but couldn't automate anything due to restrictions. 

The aim now is to make a Civilian version that can be used by Maritime Companies. Maybe even make it more generic for anyone who manages a fleet of equipment.
